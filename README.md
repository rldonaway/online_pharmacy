This project, written in Java 8, contains my solution for the challenge to write code
that will read a large file and run a query to obtain aggregate data for an
online pharmacy.

I chose not to use any third-party libraries to accomplish this, since I assumed that
the point was to demonstrate our ability to write reusable, well factored code. If
I were solving this problem under normal circumstances, I would use existing libaries
that do a much better job with file IO and CSV parsing than I did. Some CSV libraries
can handle more complicated issues with quoted strings and commas. I know this is
a more basic problem than we would be solving at Insight, but still I found it an
enjoyable thing to do. Thank you for the opportunity!
